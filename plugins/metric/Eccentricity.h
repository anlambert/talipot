/** This plugin compute the eccentricity/closeness centrality of each node
 *
 * Eccentricity is the maximum distance to go from a node to all others.
 * In this version the Eccentricity value can be normalized
 * (1 means that a node is one of the most eccentric in the network,
 * 0 means that a node is on the centers of the network).
 *
 * More information  about the use of eccentricity metric can be found in :
 *
 * Visone: Analysis and visualization of social networks. \n
 * "Book. Graph Drawing Software. (Ed. Michael Junger & Petra Mutzel", \n
 * Authors : Ulrik Brandes and Dorothea Wagner. \n
 * "2004", \n
 * pages 321-340.
 *
 *
 * Closeness Centrality is the mean of shortest-paths lengths from a node to others.
 * The normalized values are computed using the reciprocal of the sum of these distances
 * (see "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_(graph_theory)#Closeness_centrality" for more
 * details).
 *
 *  \note The complexity of the algorithm is O(|V| * |E|) time and O(1) space
 *        for unweighted graphs and O(|V| * |E| \log |V|) time for weighted graphs.
