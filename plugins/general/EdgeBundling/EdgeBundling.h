/**
 * This plugin is an implementation of the intuitive Edge Bundling technique published in :
 * "Winding Roads: Routing edges into bundles"
 * Antoine Lambert, Romain Bourqui and David Auber
 * Computer Graphics Forum special issue on 12th Eurographics/IEEE-VGTC Symposium on Visualization,
 * June 2010, pages 853-862
 *
 * Visualizations of large graphs usually suffer from visual clutter due to a large amount of edge
 * crossings and node-edge overlaps.
 * Edge bundling is a technique aiming to reduce such clutter by routing edges and grouping them
 * into bundles.
 * It also helps to uncover high level edge patterns to show how information flows between different
 * region of a graph.
 *
 * To apply this edge bundling technique, all nodes must have different positions.
 * If you encounter some crashs, try to apply the "Fast Overlap Removal" plugin before
 * executing this edge bundling plugin.
