  @brief The Project object handles the content of a Talipot project.

  All talipot projects contain a set of defined static meta-information:
  @list
  @li name (QString): the name of the project
  @li description (QString): Comments about the project
  @li author (QString): the author of the project
  @li perspective (QString): the name of the perspective plugin associated to the project
  @li date (QDate): the date of project's last modification
  @li version (QString): the version of the Talipot project format
  @endlist

  Alongside this information, one can store any kind of file into a Talipot project. Since a project
  is meant to be associated to a specific perspective, the responisbility of those file
  is left to the perspective.

  A Project DOES NOT automatically save to disk. One will have to call the write() method to
  serialize data.
  @warning Precise implementation of the Project object should NOT be known or used by the user
  since it could be subject to changes.

  If something wrong happens when calling a method from Project, this method will return either
  false or a invalid result (see specific method documentation). The last error message can be
  retrieved with the lastError() method.

  After opening and before saving a project, user will be able to list/delete files and directories
  available in the project and open them using std filestreams or Qt's QIODevice.
  Files can be opened using the stdFileStram and fileStream methods. They will always be opened in
  Read/Write mode.

  Files in a talipot project are identified by their path. Those path ar similar to the path of a
  standard file system and use the "/" character as a separator.
  The root directory is identified by "/".

  @warning Project path ALWAYS use the "/" character as a directory separator. This is
  OS-independant.

  @note A file called graph.tlp located at the top-level directory will be identified by the
  "/graph.tlp" path while the file "graph.tlp" located in the "data" directory will be identified by
  "/data/graph.tlp".
