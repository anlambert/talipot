/**
 * @ingroup OpenGL
 * @brief A class to draw Bezier curves
 *
 * This class allows to draw Bezier curves defined by an arbitrary number of control points.
 * Bezier curves are named after their inventor, Dr. Pierre Bezier. He was an engineer with the
 * Renault car company and set out in the early 1960's to develop a curve formulation which would
 * lend itself to shape design.
 * Bezier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. A Bezier curve is
 * completely contained in the convex hull of its control points and passes through its first and
 * last control points. The curve is also always tangent to the first and last convex hull polygon
 * segments.
 * In addition, the curve shape tends to follow the polygon shape.
